## Gameplay
You, "Hero", are stuck in a dungeon looking for a key for a locked room to escape. 
Each time you play the locked room is choosen at random.
You can navigate through the rooms of the dungeon by entering "go north", "go east", "go west" or "go south".
You view the map, by entering "map", to help you along the way. The [ ] brackets show you where you are and the ! ! show you where you might encounter a witch or a zombie.
The witch guards the key and you will have to defeat her by entering "attack" but she can only be defeated when you possess the potion.
The zombie can also be defeated by entering attack.
Beware, they do attack back.
